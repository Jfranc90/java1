Write code for a program that prompts the user for a month and day and prints out whether
         * it is one of the following holidays:
         * - New Years (Jan 1)
         * - Independence Day (July 4)
         * - Veterans (Nov 11)
         * - Halloween (Oct 30)
         * - Any holiday is fine, try to add atleast 4
         
Write a program that reads three numbers and print "increasing" if they are in increasing order
         * 'decreasing' if they are in decreasing order, and "neither" other-wise. Here "increasing" mean
         * "strictly" increasing. 3 5 11 -> increasing 3 4 4 -> not increasing

/** Find the errors in the code below:
         * if x > 0 then system.out.println(x);
